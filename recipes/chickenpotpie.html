    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>1 to 2 packages frozen puff pastry, best quality such as Dufour or Pepperidge Farm, thawed (see note)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen pearl onions (no need to defrost)</li>
        <li>3 carrots, sliced into ¼-inch rounds</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the pastry</li>
        <li>2½ cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Cognac or brandy (okay to replace with more chicken broth if avoiding alcohol)</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme (or a combination thyme, rosemary and sage), plus a few thyme springs for serving</li>
        <li>3-4 cups shredded cooked chicken, from 1 rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas (no need to defrost)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F and set an oven rack to the center position.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: In a large sauté pan over medium heat, melt the butter. 
        <li>Add the yellow onion, garlic, celery, pearl onions, and carrots. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are just cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. Add the broth, cognac, salt, and white pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom and corners of the pan to incorporate the flour. Simmer until thickened, a few minutes. Off the heat, stir in the heavy cream, thyme, chicken, and peas. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. (Note that the broth will taste a little boozy at this point. That's okay - the cognac will cook off in the oven.)</li>
        <li>Ladle the filling into 4 large or 6 small oven-safe soup bowls. The filling should come up no more than three-quarters of the way to the top of the bowls. Do not overfill.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water.</li>
        <li>Remove the pastry rounds from the refrigerator. Brush the outside edges of each bowl with the egg wash.</li>
        <li>Place the cold dough rounds over the bowls, pressing firmly around the edges so that the dough adheres. Transfer the bowls to the foil-lined baking sheet. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Using a sharp knife, make a ½-inch slit in the top of each pie. Place the bowls on the foil-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry is a rich golden brown. Let cool for about 10 minutes, then use a wide spatula to carefully transfer the hot bowls to serving plates. Sprinkle a few fresh thyme sprigs over top of the bowls and serve.</li>
        <li>MAKE AHEAD: The pies may be assembled and refrigerated up to a day ahead of time. Brush the top of the dough with egg wash before baking.</li>
